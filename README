nagios / icinga mail flow checker plugin

Scripts taken from http://troels.arvin.dk/code/nagios/mail_flow/
modified by C. Holtermann to use ODBC database access

Different databases:
I've tested it with PostgreSQL which works as it did before. MariaDB works only from 10.3 because of SEQUENCE support. I didn't have the chance to test that yet. As far as I know there is no support for this in sqlite.

dependencies:
* ODBC
* ODBC drivers: i.e. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/
* ODBC python access: pyodbc
